/**
 * Bootstrapping an account that is a member of nothing, from an invitation.
 *
 * # The one missing step
 *
 * A freshly enrolled account holds a certified device and belongs to no
 * namespace, so `CloudClient.getAccountRelays` answers `[]` — correctly, because
 * nothing serves an account that is a member of nothing. It is still signed in;
 * what it has no way to do is write. An invitation is what changes that, and the
 * chain is:
 *
 *     invitation → namespaceId → a node URL
 *                → POST the signed join to that node  → the account is a member
 *                → that same node is the relay, from this moment
 *                → a fleet relay writes the recovery envelope asynchronously,
 *                  and getAccountRelays() agrees from then on
 *
 * The session does not wait for the cloud to catch up. The node that carried the
 * join is known to serve the namespace now; the lookup will agree later.
 *
 * # Where the node URL comes from, in preference order
 *
 * 1. one passed in — an operator's, or one a future invitation carries. Core
 *    today emits only libp2p multiaddrs on an invitation (`resolve_admitter_addrs`)
 *    because a node cannot know the URL its admin API is proxied on, so there is
 *    nothing to read off the invitation yet and this is the seam for when there
 *    is;
 * 2. the cloud's `/api/cloud/namespaces/{ns}/admitters`, intersected with the
 *    invitation's signed `admitters` — see `resolveRelayFromInvitation`.
 *
 * # Nothing here is minted, weakened or worked around
 *
 * The credential and the device secret come from the enrolment the wallet
 * already performed. The op is signed by that device key, which is what stops an
 * admitter substituting a different member. The admitters intersection is done in
 * `resolveRelayFromInvitation` and is never relaxed.
