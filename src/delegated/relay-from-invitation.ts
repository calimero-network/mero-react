/**
 * Resolving a relay from an INVITATION rather than from an account.
 *
 * # The gap this closes
 *
 * `ConnectButtonAccount` finds a relay by asking the cloud what serves the
 * *account* (`CloudClient.getAccountRelays`). A freshly enrolled account is a
 * member of nothing, so that read correctly answers `[]` and the button
 * correctly refuses to connect: there is nowhere to write, and a typed guess
 * would be a node that refuses every warrant.
 *
 * But a newcomer is not stuck — they are holding an invitation, and an
 * invitation names a namespace. `CloudClient.getNamespaceRouting` answers which
 * nodes serve *that namespace*, and it is deliberately anonymous: a joiner has
 * no cloud session, and needing one is exactly what this path exists to avoid.
 * So the bootstrap order is namespace first, account second — admission is what
 * makes `getAccountRelays` answer at all, not the other way round.
 *
 * # Two sources, one intersection, and why it must not be skipped
 *
 * The invitation's `admitters` list sits INSIDE the body the group admin
 * signed, so it is authorization: merod answers `403` to an `/admit` from a node
 * that list does not name, whatever else is true of it. The cloud's list is
 * every node currently assigned to the namespace — it cannot know which
 * invitation the caller holds, so it cannot filter by the signed list, and a
 * node assigned *after* the invitation was minted looks perfect in every field
 * the cloud reports and still refuses the claim.
 *
 * Intersecting here is therefore not belt-and-braces: it is the check that
 * turns an unexplainable `403` into "your invitation names none of these nodes,
 * ask for a fresh one". It is never relaxed to make a flow work.
 *
 * # `servable` and `canAdmit` are advisory; `writable` is information
 *
 * `servable` and `canAdmit` are derived from assignment heartbeats, and a lapsed
 * heartbeat is not the same fact as a node that will refuse. Measured against
 * prod: the cloud reported `servable: false, canAdmit: false, fresh: false` for a
 * node whose `/admin-api/health` answered `{"status":"alive"}` and which had just
 * minted the invitation being claimed. Gating on them meant refusing to knock on
 * an open door, so a node with an address is tried and the NODE decides —
 * `admit_join` re-verifies the invitation, the signature and the admitters list,
 * so asking loosens nothing and a refusal names its own cause. `stale` on the
 * result says the attempt rests on advisory data.
 *
 * `writable` — and its per-node form, `canExecute` — is about `CAN_AUTHOR_ON_BEHALF`,
 * which admission does **not** require: relaying a join the joiner signed is not
 * authoring on anyone's behalf. So a non-writable namespace is not a refusal
 * here; it is reported on the result, because it is precisely why the writes
 * would fail *after* connecting, and a caller that cannot tell the two apart
 * sends the user to the wrong place.

 *
 * - `admitters-lookup` — the cloud read itself failed (offline, 5xx, a refused
 *   routing proof). Nothing has been learned about the namespace.
 * - `no-nodes` — the read succeeded and the cloud lists nothing. The namespace
 *   has no fleet assignment, so there is no cloud node to admit through; the
 *   invitation's admitters are somebody's self-hosted or desktop node, which the
 *   cloud neither knows nor routes to.
 * - `not-invited` — nodes serve the namespace, and the invitation names none of
 *   them. Terminal for this invitation: ask for a fresh one.
 * - `invited-unreachable` — a named node exists but cannot take a join now (no
 *   fresh heartbeat, or the cloud reports the namespace as not servable). A
 *   wait, not a wrong invitation.
 * - `no-relay-url` — a named node can admit but the cloud knows no address for
 *   it, so there is nothing to connect through afterwards. Also a wait: it is
 *   the shape a node reports before its first heartbeat lands.
