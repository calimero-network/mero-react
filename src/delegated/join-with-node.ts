/**
 * Present a signed join to ONE named node.
 *
 * This is the whole of admission for a caller with no node of its own: sign the
 * membership op with the device key the account certified, and POST it to a node
 * the invitation named as an admitter.
 *
 *     POST /admin-api/namespaces/{namespaceId}/admit
 *     { "invitation": SignedGroupOpenInvitation, "signedOp": "<hex borsh SignedNamespaceOp>" }
 *
 * Verified against core at rc.43 — `crates/server/src/admin/handlers/namespaces/
 * admit_join.rs`, request type `AdmitJoinApiRequest` in
 * `crates/server/primitives/src/admin/mod.rs`. The handler also refuses a
 * mismatch between the invitation's `group_id` and the namespace in the path, so
 * the two are never allowed to disagree here.
 *
 * ## Why it needs no token and no proof
 *
 * The joiner's signature IS the authorization. The op is signed by the device
 * key named in the credential it carries, and every peer checks
 * `signer == credential.statement.sign_pk` before applying a join — so an
 * admitter can carry this and can never author it: it cannot admit a different
 * account, change the group, or grant a role. It can refuse, and that is all.
 * This is also why the fleet ingress leaves the route unauthenticated, and why
 * this posts with `fetch` rather than through `AdminApiClient`, which is built
 * around a node credential this caller does not have.
 *
 * ## Why it lives here and not in mero-js
 *
 * Two reasons. `mero-js` is read-only for this change by instruction, and the
 * shape that is actually useful to a caller is the one that hands back a
 * {@link DelegatedSession} — the node that admitted you is the node to connect
 * through — which is `mero-react`'s concern. The pieces that are pure SDK, the
 * borsh op layout and the request type, are used from `mero-js` unchanged and
 * are not reimplemented here.
 *
 * ## Why the op has no parents
 *
 * A keyholder holds no node, so it has no view of the namespace DAG and cannot
 * name its heads. Empty parents is the only thing it *can* sign, and the direct
 * admission path exists precisely for callers in that position.
